# Disable Divi Projects

While building a website for someone, I needed a simple way to disable/hide the built in Divi 'Projects' custom post type without needing to create a child theme and adding the code to the `functions.php` file.

This plugin does one simple job. When activated, it hides the Divi 'Projects' custom post type from the left-hand navigation menu in WordPress.
